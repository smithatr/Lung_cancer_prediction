Title: Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

METHODOLOGY:
The "Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning" project uses a model combining k-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, Balanced Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine to optimize precision, accuracy, and reliability in predicting lung cancer likelihood, addressing class imbalance concerns and high-dimensional feature spaces.

SOFTWARE TOOLS:
•	Language used is python.
•	Tools used for implementation is Google Colabs and Excel for plotting the outputs.
•	ML Techniques used are: 
i)	 Random Forest                                ii)            K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
ii)	Support Vector Machine (SVM)      iv)            Balanced Random Forest
CONCLUSION:
The project utilized machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Balanced Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine to predict lung cancer. The models achieved an accuracy of 97%, F-score of 98.18, and precision score of 96.42 in early detection.
